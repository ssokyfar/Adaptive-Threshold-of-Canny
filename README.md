## Adaptive-Threshold-of-Canny
Three method to generate the adaptive threshold of canny algorithm:<br> 
>Method 1.OTSU<br> 
>Method 2.By compute gradient histogram<br> 
>Method 3.By compute the Maximum gradient variance.(this method is the best)<br> 

## Build Environment
>VS2015,OpenCV3.4.1

## Image Folder
>The image we used to test code is in "input image" folder<br>
>The three kind of result correspondence to each "input image" is in "result image" folder<br>
